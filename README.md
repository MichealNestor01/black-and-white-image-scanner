# black-and-white-image-scanner
- Scans a black and white image and produces a heat map of the density of black pixels within the given image.

This was a commision project that I created in July 2021.
It will split a given image into squares 331x331 and take the count of black pixels in each. 
It will use this count to produce a heat map of the density of black pixels as well as text file with the count of each region's black pixel.
Allow a few minutes for the program to run in which time it will be unresponsive.

Required labels:
